Engine version 0.2.349 changelog:

API:
API Version 0.10.0:

General API stuff:
Enhanced the extant Vector2, Color3, and Color4 converters to convert to strings as well as from them. This is required for XML output capabilities and therefore for the IDE.

DataModel Core and InstanceInfo:
This is where most of the work today went.

InstanceInfo has been substantially overhauled to add functionality to dynamically identify and store the .NET accessibility level of properties.
This is done with the InstanceAccessibility enum, and is required for proper XML output capabilities. Only public properties are serialised to XML; any property may be deserialised from XML.

Therefore, many properties have been changed from public to internal, public to private and vice versa. It took almost two hours to fix all of the issues this required change caused.

Implemented Ungrouping. Ungrouping is a method on the Instance class - Ungroup - where an Instance's children are moved to be children of its pareent and then the Instance is removed.

DDMS:
Added XML output capability. (it was technically in the last build but it was absurdly broken and unfinished).
I haven't tested it, but it should work totally fine now with the engine! (don't worry I will test it lol). 
DDMS now stores the last XML path; this will be moved to a static datamodel property.

GameSettings:
Several new GameSettings have been implemented:

FreeCameraMoveIntensityX: The movement intensity of FreeCameras in the X direction.
FreeCameraMoveIntensityY: The movement intensity of FreeCameras in the Y direction.
ChaseCameraInFrontOrBehindObjectFactor: The factor by which ChaseCameras will place themselves in front or behind the object - in front is negative, behind is positive: larger is closer to the centre.
ChaseCameraAboveOrBelowObjectFactor: The factor that ChaseCameras will place themselves above or below the object - above is negative, behind is positive: larger is closer to the centre.
