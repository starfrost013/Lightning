Lightning version 0.3.637

General:
Updated version to 0.3
Updated API version to 0.16.0.

API:
- Began work on UI:

Began work on events too, but there's not much in there right now.

Implemented GuiRoot:
The root of all GUIs. Currently unused - used in the latest builds but not in 637.

Implemented ScreenGui:
A GUI that appears locked to the physical screen. Currently unused - used in the latest builds but not in 637.

Implemented Font:
A font.
FontPath: The path to a TTF file containing the font. MUST BE TTF!
FontSize: The font size to load from the TTF file.

Implemented Text:

Implements FreeType text.

Properties:
Content: The content of the text you wish to render.
Bold: If true, the text is bold.
Italic: If true, the text is italic.
Underline: If true, the text is underline.
OutlinePixels: If more than 0, the text will have an outline, with the size in pixels being the value of this property.
FontFamily: The font family of the text. MUST be set to the Name property of a VALID Font loaded in your XML
The Color and Position properties also work as you would expect.

Services:
PhysicsService:
Handles physics. Currently a stub, has no functionality yet.

UIService:
Handles and renders UI.

Scripting:
- Added a Lua sandbox. Lua code is sent to a specialised script that runs your Lua code.
- Implemented a Lua debugging profiler using the Lua debug hook.
    - Lightning now prints out how long a Lua script has been running for.
    - Lightning now aborts a script if it has been running longer than a specified time - this is defined as MaxLuaScriptExecutionTime in GlobalSettings.xml

Native Interop:
Added tons of code for Win32 and COM common dialogs to Lightning.Core.NativeInterop.

Polaris:
A lot of work has gone into the script editor behind the scnees, so that it now actually works, although text isn't displayed.
The Open dialog box now tries to do something, even if it fails.

Miscellaneous:
- Platform system rewritten:
    + Lightning now detects the version of the platform that you are running on - in earlier versions it simply detected the platform itself. Lightning currently detects Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and 11.
* Changed colour of "Lightning" text in the Launcher.
- Minor refactoring to adding instances.
probably some stuff missing
and it's quite brief due to just how much has changed
