Lightning version 0.3.646

**Errors:**
Errors.xml is no longer used.

Instead, errors have been converted to a function in the static ErrorRegistration class (transpiled from XML by the Lightning.Tools.ErrorConvert.exe tool) that is called by the error manager code.

**UI:**
All UI elements must be wrapped in a valid GUI type, wrapped inside a GuiRoot, like so:
example:

    <GuiRoot>
      <WorldGui Name="ScGui">
        <Text Content="I am world text!" Colour="255,255,0,0" Position="329,461" FontFamily="Arial.18pt"></Text>
      </WorldGui>
    </GuiRoot>

Implemented `WorldGui`:
A GUI where all of the UI elements are placed within the world, as opposed to on the scren with ScreenGui.

Other:
* Refactored the UI system to make it less bleh.
* Changed the error message used by ScreenGui when it fails to acquire the list of GUI elements to draw.

637 stuff I forgot:
Added InstanceTags.UsesNonstandardRenderPath: Signifies that this type uses a non-standard rendering path (such as being rendered by another object). This must be on for all GUI objects.
