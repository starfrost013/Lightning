Engine version 0.2.321 changelog

API changes:
API Version 0.9.0:
Major updates to `Camera`:
`Camera`s can now have multiple types; this is determined by their `CameraType` property.
They can also now target objects - see the `TargetName` property.

CameraType enum:
`Free` - the camera is free, and can be moved throughout the level by the arrow keys or WASD. (next build will have these user-assignable)
`FollowObject` - the camera will move itself as to centre an object in the middle of it. The object it targets is controlled by the `TargetName` property, where `TargetName` is the `Name` of any object that is or inherits from `PhysicalObject` in the game. - the `Target` will be able to be directly set in scripts as well. 
`ChaseObject` - similar to `FollowObject`, except the camera will position itself behind and slightly above the object it is targeting, as if it was recording a chase.
`Fixed` - the camera will not move.

Added `PhysicalObject.OnSpawn()`: RenderService calls this after it finishes initialising and loading textures - PhysicalObjects can use this to initialise.

GameMetadata has been updated with new properties:
`Name`: The name of the Game.
`Version`: An optional version number for the Game.

DDMS:
Added serialisation (saving) of files. Split serialisation and deserialisation into multiple files (partial classes ofc); had my terminology confused. Currently, this code isn't called by anything because it's unfinished - more work needs to be done before it will work properly.

Updated the XML schema version to 0.3.0.0006:
Adds `Metadata.Name` and `Metadata.Version`: these reflect GameMetadata's Name and Version properties.
Made Description and Author optional.

Other:
Refactoring in various places of the engine.
Added a helper method to InstanceInfo to get the value of an object from a property and an instance of the object.

ServiceControlManager:
Fixed the shutdown procedure to actually clear the DataModel in the intended way.

Utilities:
Overhauled `GetXmlPath` to actually work; the next build will fix the issue with XML paths as a result
