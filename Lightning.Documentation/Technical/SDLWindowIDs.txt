Lightning Window IDs
January 4, 2022

SDL2 supports up to 4 windows using a Window ID system. To facilitate the boot splashscreen, Lightning assigns hardcoded Window IDs to each window. As of 1/4/22 these are the following:

ID 0: BootWindow (splash screen) 
ID 1: MainWindow (main Lightning NuRender window)
