Lightning - C#/CX Scripting

Version 2.0
January 15, 2022

January 14, 2022		Initial version
January 15, 2022		Rewrote for XML events

Lightning will load game code from a DLL defined in the game's CodeDLL and CodeNamespace GameSetting. Types are automatically loaded from the DLL at engine init.

The engine will automatically call GMain.Init(); in the DLL. DLLs must have a static class of this name with this method, taking no parameters other than one NuRender.Scene, with a name of the developers' choosing. This is distinct to the main C# Main method in order to allow non-Lightning code to run before. 

The game will be rejected for boot if its GameDLL does not fit these measures. Please note that CodeDLLs are optional and are only intended for advanced users.

Events will be handled in XML by adding a simple reference to the code that is being submitted. The default class will be GMain, and it must be static. At some point (Lightning 2.0?) a real event handling infrastructure will be implemented.

On the triggering of these events, ScriptingServiceCX will call all code that it can that has subscribed to that event. Alternatively, one can extend the DataModel and subscribe to Lightning-prebuilt events, or simply use GMain.Render();, which will be called each frame by default.

Lightning usings will also be restricted to Lightning.Core.API
