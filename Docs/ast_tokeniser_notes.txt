Tokenisation Notes
June 1, 2021

Lightning uses a three-phase tokeniser (Phases 0, 1, and 2). The first phase simply takes all of the ScriptContent defined in a Script object and splits it into individual lines. The second phase performs some basic analysis and then converts the text into a series of logical token objects.

The third phase sorts the flat list generated by the second phase (Phase 1) into an abstract syntax tree based on basic syntactical patterns it analyses during Phase 1 (ASTPatterns.)
