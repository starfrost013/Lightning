# Lightning Game Engine
## Code of Conduct (March 6, 2021)

Welcome to the Lightning game engine main tree. We are going to have to ask you abide by a few rules if you wish to contribute code.

* Be respectful. This is the Prime Directive of development here and you have to follow it. Bigotry, unpleasantness, jackassery, and various other forms of unfortunately negative behaviours will not be tolerated and will result in you being removed. 

* This is a private repository and please treat it as such!

* All code you check into the main branch must compile. Do a private build to check that it compiles before committing it into the main tree!

* Please submit design changes!
