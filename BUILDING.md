# Building Lightning

To build Lightning, these development tools are required:

* Visual Studio 2019 on Windows (any supported OS -- currently, this will change in the future)
* .NET Core 3.1 SDK

Everything else should be included.

You will also need to change the post-build events in Lightning.csproj to output a 7z file somewhere that exists on your machine.
